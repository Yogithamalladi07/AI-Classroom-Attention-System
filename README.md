# 🎓 Smart Classroom Student Monitoring System

This project is a **Real-Time AI-Powered Classroom Monitoring System** that tracks and evaluates student behaviors such as hand-raising, head position, emotion, and body posture using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It aims to provide automated attendance and attention analysis during online or physical classroom sessions.

## 🧠 Features

### 📌 1. Hand Raise Detection (`HandRaiseDetection.py`)
- Detects if a student has raised their hand during class.
- Recognizes faces using ORB descriptors and OpenCV's DNN Face Detector.
- Attendance is marked in `attendance.xlsx` with hand-raising status.

### 📌 2. Head Position & Attention Detection (`headposition.py`)
- Uses face mesh and pose estimation to determine if the student is looking at the instructor or distracted.
- Trains a face recognizer using student images.
- Logs attention status to `attention.xlsx`.

### 📌 3. Emotion Detection (`emotion.py`)
- Recognizes real-time facial emotions using a pre-trained CNN (`emotion_detection_model.h5`).
- Identifies students by comparing detected faces with saved student images.
- Logs the most frequently detected emotion in `emotion_attendance.xlsx`.

### 📌 4. Body Language Analysis (`BodyLanguageAnalysis.py`)
- Tracks student posture and detects head tilt using MediaPipe Pose.
- Recognizes students and logs their attentiveness to `student_attendance.xlsx`.

🖼️ Student Images
Place individual student face images inside the student image folder. Image file names should be the student's name (e.g., john_doe.jpg).
